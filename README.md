The dataset provided to you contains 500 signal segments of 23.6 seconds in length, which were collected from a device with a sampling frequency of 173.61 Hz. So you will have an input file of length 4097 for each data. There are also 500 data files that are classified in five different groups, and you can see the descriptions of these groups and access to the data in the link below.

in Part 1 first we extracted 15 features foreach 500 segments after that we classify our dataset. 


in Part 2 first we choose best features from 15 features and delete others , after that we use clustring to improve our classfiers then we calculate accuracy and percision and recall foreach classfier .
